# Changelog

All notable changes to robotsix-central-deploy.

<!-- towncrier release notes start -->

## 0.0.0 (unreleased)

- Add `claude-auth` named volume seed migration tests covering idempotent re-run, absent host source, and rmtree failure; clean `claude_host_mount_path` from OpenAPI spec and configuration docs.
- Replace host bind mount for `robotsix.deploy.claude-mount` with a central-deploy-managed named volume `claude-auth`. The `claude_host_mount_path` setting is removed; claude credentials now live in a Docker named volume mounted at `/home/app/.claude`. A one-time migration seeds the volume from `/home/debian/.claude` if present. Deploying a claude-mount component without valid credentials surfaces a dashboard warning.
- Host port auto-assignment at onboarding: when a new component's default host port collides with an existing component or central-deploy's own port, `onboard_preflight` auto-assigns a free port (10000-20000 range) and returns the shifts in `port_shifts`. Port collision tickets are filed on affected components' mill boards when reachable; unreachable-mill warnings are surfaced in the job status response and dashboard.
- Eliminate triple field duplication by deriving `SystemSettingsResponse` and `SystemSettingsUpdate` from `SystemSettings` instead of `BaseModel`.
- Migrate component-config onboarding to the JSON config-standard: fetch `config/config.json` + `config/config.example.json`, parse/write JSON (`config.json`) instead of YAML. Compose parsing stays YAML. (Pairs with each component's config-standard migration.)

- Dashboard: add deploy history modal with per-entry rollback controls and full running digest tooltips
- Refactor `lifecycle/backend.py` (1541 lines) into a `lifecycle/backends/` package
  with one file per implementation: `base.py`, `noop.py`, `docker_cli.py`,
  `docker_sdk.py`, and `_util.py`. The original `backend.py` is kept as a
  backward-compatible re-export shim.
- Fix caretaker auto-update pulling a bare digest: `phase_update` passed `latest_registry_digest` (`sha256:…`) as the image reference, which docker resolves as repository "sha256" and 404s — every auto-update failed on the live server. It now deploys `repo@sha256:…` (tag fallback when no digest), and `deploy()` digest derivation handles pinned refs so `update_available` clears correctly.
- Remove dead `OnboardConfirmResponse` schema (superseded by `OnboardConfirmAcceptedResponse`)
  Regenerated `docs/openapi.json` to reflect the active schema.
- Adopt towncrier newsfragments (`changelog.d/`) as the changelog mechanism; CHANGELOG.md becomes release-workflow-written only. Added `towncrier>=24.0` dev dependency and `[tool.towncrier]` config.
- Per-component deploy history: every successful deploy (manual, caretaker, or rollback) now records a timestamped entry with the resolved digest, image ref, source, and previous digest. The history is capped at 20 entries per component, exposed via `GET /services/{name}/history`, and rollback can target any recorded digest via `POST /services/{name}/rollback {"digest": "<sha256:...>"}`.
- Env/secrets modal: the key set is the repo's compose contract, not operator-editable — removed "+ Add variable"/"+ Add secret" and per-row delete. New "↻ Sync keys from repo" button (POST /services/{name}/env/sync-keys) seeds keys the contract added since onboarding (values never modified; undeclared stored keys reported, not deleted).
- Fix contradictory copy on unset secret fields in config forms: rows showed both "(required — set before deploy)" and "optional at onboard" at once. Unset secrets now read "(not set — can be saved later, needed to run)".
- **Breaking (claude-mount):** the `robotsix.deploy.claude-mount` bind target moved from `/root/.claude` to `/home/app/.claude`, matching the robotsix-standards standardized container layout (non-root user `app`, uid 1001, home `/home/app`). Images still running as `root` (e.g. robotsix-mill) must set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/app/.claude` until they migrate to the standard layout.
- Config help bubbles now show the schema's field `description` (falling back to the dotted key path), and section headers render their description. Added descriptions to every `LifecycleConfig` field (regenerated `config/config.schema.json`). New `POST /services/{name}/config/refresh-schema` endpoint + "↻ Refresh schema" button in the Configure modal: refetches the repo's committed `config/config.schema.json` and replaces the stored template (values untouched), so components onboarded pre-schema pick up typed fields and descriptions without re-onboarding.
- Fix caretaker mill discovery URL: derive `http://{container_name}:{container_port}` instead of `http://localhost:{host_port}` — managed components publish no host ports, so the caretaker must reach the mill over the shared proxy network like the gateway does.
- Fix empty Configure modal for components onboarded before the schema-driven config UI (e.g. mill, mail): the typed renderer only understood JSON Schema and silently rendered nothing for stored legacy YAML templates. Legacy templates are now converted to a pseudo-schema client-side (SECRET sentinel → masked input, typed number/bool inputs), arrays render as editable JSON instead of `[object Object]`, and the onboard config step recognises legacy-template repos again.
- Fix deployment breakage from the robotsix_config migration: `docker-compose.yml` still set the now-ignored `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_*` env vars, so a pulled post-migration image started with baked-in defaults (unix docker socket, memory store) and crash-looped. Compose now sets `ROBOTSIX_CONFIG_FILE=/data/config.json`; docs/deployment.md documents seeding the file.
- Add Dependabot auto-merge caller workflow (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)
- Regenerate `config/config.json` and `config/config.example.json` to include `mill_component_id` and `image_auto_prune` defaults.
- **Breaking:** `LifecycleConfig` migrated from `pydantic-settings` env-var loading to `robotsix_config.load_config` (JSON file). Operators must replace `config/config.json` with a deployment-specific file containing real secrets — the committed version carries safe empty-string defaults. Added `config/config.json`, `config/config.example.json`, and `config/config.schema.json` with a CI drift check.
- Migrate from `robotsix-yaml-config` to `robotsix-config` dependency; YAML primitives (`read_yaml_file`, `deep_merge`, and the exception types) replaced with a local `_yaml_utils` module backed by `pyyaml`.
- Render typed, validated inputs in the config form driven by JSON Schema (`config.schema.json`): number inputs for `integer`/`number`, checkboxes for `boolean`, dropdowns for `enum`, password inputs for `format:password` + `writeOnly:true`, text inputs for plain strings, and section groups for nested `object` types. Required fields are marked with `*` and defaults from `propSchema.default` are prefilled. Secret detection now uses schema metadata (`format` + `writeOnly`) instead of the old `"SECRET"` sentinel value.
- Migrate config handling from YAML-sentinel templates to JSON Schema: onboard
  preflight now fetches `config/config.schema.json`, secrets are detected via
  `format: password` + `writeOnly: true`, and submitted config is validated
  against the schema before writing to the container volume. The old
  `_CONFIG_SECRET_SENTINEL` / `_annotate_secret_sentinels` path is removed.
- Fix `inspect_self` losing track of the server's own container after a watchtower self-update: the recreated container keeps the *previous* container's hostname (watchtower copies the config verbatim), so the container-id hostname lookup missed and `GET /system/update` reported `supported: false` until the next compose recreate. A fallback now scans running containers for a matching `Config.Hostname`.
- **Fix self-update failing on first real use.** The one-shot watchtower launched by `POST /system/update` crashed twice: (1) watchtower 1.7.1's Docker client defaults to API 1.25, below modern daemons' minimum (1.44), panicking on the first API call — the updater now receives `DOCKER_API_VERSION` (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_SELF_UPDATE_DOCKER_API_VERSION`, default `1.44`); (2) recreating the central-deploy container 403'd because watchtower re-attaches networks via `POST /networks/{id}/connect`, which the socket proxy blocked — the compose socket-proxy scope now sets `NETWORKS: "1"`. Found live on server.robotsix.net; the failed run left the old container stopped, so deployments should update the socket-proxy (`docker compose up -d`) when picking this up.
- Dashboard: add caretaker settings (enable/disable, interval) to System Settings panel, mill tracking opt-in to onboard flow, untracked badge for components without repo_id, and degraded-reporting banner when caretaker is enabled but mill is unreachable.
- Enable `changelog_autofill` periodic workflow to automate changelog entry insertion for PRs missing the `changelog` check.
- **Dashboard self-update button.** New `GET/POST /system/update` endpoints: GET compares the running server's image digest (resolved from its own container via the container-id hostname) against the registry; POST launches a one-shot watchtower container (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_SELF_UPDATE_WATCHTOWER_IMAGE`, default `containrrr/watchtower:1.7.1`) that pulls the new image and recreates the central-deploy container from outside the process. The watchtower container joins the server's own networks (the socket proxy blocks `/networks/*/connect`, so all endpoints are attached in the create payload) and auto-removes when done. The dashboard header shows an "⬆ Update server" button when an update is available; after confirming, it polls until the recreated server answers with a new digest, then reloads. `system` is now a reserved component name.
- Expose `caretaker_enabled` and `caretaker_interval_hours` as `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_CARETAKER_ENABLED` / `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_CARETAKER_INTERVAL_HOURS` env vars, seed them on first boot, and round-trip them through `GET/PUT /settings`.
- **Publish the image to GHCR and harden the Dockerfile per the docker standard.** A new `release.yml` calls the shared `docker-release.yml` reusable workflow on every push to main (tags: `main`, `sha-<short>`, `latest`; SBOM + provenance attestation; Trivy release gate), publishing `ghcr.io/damien-robotsix/robotsix-central-deploy`. The compose file now references that image (`docker compose pull` to update; `build: .` kept for local dev). Dockerfile: digest-pinned `python:3.14-slim` in both stages, uv brought in via `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` instead of `pip install uv`, runtime copies only site-packages + the console script, **runs as non-root (uid 1000)**, and declares a `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health`. ⚠ Existing deployments must chown the `central_deploy_data` volume once before running the non-root image (see docs/deployment.md).
- Align with the robotsix-standards repo baseline: add the MIT `LICENSE` file, switch the build backend from setuptools to hatchling (with `allow-direct-references` for the git-pinned first-party deps), link to [robotsix-standards](https://github.com/damien-robotsix/robotsix-standards) from README/AGENT.md, and add a `mkdocs build --strict` CI gate. Hatchling resolves the `ui/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` symlink when building the wheel (setuptools shipped a dangling link), so the Dockerfile now copies `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` into the build stage and drops the post-install site-packages copy workaround. `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` now declares itself the canonical home of the deploy contract (the copy in robotsix-standards had drifted and is now a pointer page).
- Dashboard onboard modal now polls `GET /onboard/jobs/{job_id}` after confirm, showing live deploy-phase progress (writing_config, deploying_primary, waiting_health, deploying_siblings, done, failed). The modal no longer waits on a single long request that could be dropped by nginx.
- Onboard form: mark secret fields as optional with clearer placeholder text and informational notes explaining the fill-later flow via Configure → Save.
- Fix ``AttributeError: 'State' object has no attribute 'job_registry'`` in lifecycle conftest fixture (the ``_reset_globals`` autouse fixture now initializes ``app.state.job_registry`` so validation-error tests on the onboard confirm endpoint don't crash before body validation).
- `POST /onboard/confirm` now returns `202 Accepted` with a job id instead of blocking for the full deploy. The long-running deploy sequence (primary deploy, health gate, sibling deploys) runs as an asyncio background task. Poll `GET /onboard/jobs/{job_id}` for phase progress (`writing_config` → `deploying_primary` / `waiting_health` → `deploying_siblings` → `done` / `failed`). A second confirm for the same component while a job is active returns `409 Conflict`.
- **Remove path-prefix gateway routing.** `deploy.robotsix.net/<name>/...` URLs are no longer proxied — path-prefix proxying broke any component app serving absolute asset URLs (e.g. `/static/…`). Components are now reached exclusively via their subdomain (`<name>.deploy.robotsix.net`, requires `gateway_base_domain`); legacy path URLs 307-redirect to the subdomain. WebSocket gateway connections are subdomain-only (non-subdomain hosts close with 4004). `http_proxy` loses its `prefix` param and the `x-forwarded-prefix` header / Location-rewrite logic.
- Record volume hash during config assist so drift detection works after auto-detected config changes.
- Add a `dependency-review` CI job (`actions/dependency-review-action`, `fail-on-severity: high`) that blocks PRs introducing dependencies with known high-severity vulnerabilities. Requires the repository's Dependency graph to be enabled (now on).
- Config drift UI: when a component's config has been edited out-of-band, the dashboard now shows a warning banner with Import/Edit-stale options, blocks blind Save with a conflict diff panel, and supports import-from-volume and explicit overwrite flows.
- `_rollback_onboard` now removes orphaned containers (primary + siblings) via `backend.remove_container` and cleans up any freshly-seeded `EnvStore` entry, preventing resource leaks when onboard deploy fails.
- Add inverse preflight gate: `/onboard/preflight` now returns 422 when a service declares `robotsix.deploy.config-target` but the repo yields no config schema (no `config/config.yaml`, `config/config.example.yaml`, or valid template). This prevents deploying containers with empty config volumes that would crash-loop.
- Document test-file organization rule: test files for module X belong under `tests/X/`, never at the `tests/` root
- Config drift detection: `ConfigYamlStore` now records a `volume_hash` after every write to a config volume. `GET /services/{name}/config` surfaces a `drift` flag when the live volume content diverges from the stored hash. `PUT /services/{name}/config` blocks blind overwrites on drift (HTTP 409) unless `force_overwrite: true` is passed. `POST /services/{name}/config/import` resyncs the store from the live volume, clearing drift.
- Add docstrings to all 16 public route handlers in `lifecycle/routers/services.py`, covering purpose, error responses, and side effects (sibling fan-out, store writes).
- PR #182 (docs: sync index and configuration pages with current code) — already merged; no further changes needed
- Add regression test confirming `TypeError` during port parsing is caught as `ParseError`. The existing bare-comma `except ValueError, TypeError:` syntax is correct Python 3.14+ under PEP 758 — it catches both exception types and is the `ruff format`-preferred style.
- Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for ruff, ruff-format, mypy, and common file checks (end-of-file, trailing-whitespace, merge-conflict, large-files)
- Add `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — comprehensive architecture guide covering system
  components, subpackage responsibilities, data flow, state machine, gateway
  routing rules, and key design decisions.
- Add `"volumes"`, `"login"`, and `"logout"` to `RESERVED_NAMES` in the gateway router to prevent onboarding components that would shadow central-deploy routes.
- Define `ExecutionBackendType(str, Enum)` in `lifecycle/models.py` with members `DOCKER_SDK`, `DOCKER`, `NOOP`, replacing bare `str` typing for the `execution_backend` config field. Update config, deps, cli, and all test fixtures to use the enum. Add grep-lint CI check for raw execution-backend strings outside `models.py`.
- Add `docker_sdk_timeout` config (default 120 s) to prevent indefinite blocking on Docker SDK operations like `images.pull()`; wired into `DockerSdkBackend` constructor and `LifecycleConfig` (env: `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_DOCKER_SDK_TIMEOUT`)
- Adopt `robotsix-yaml-config` for shared YAML primitives: replace local `_deep_merge` with `robotsix_yaml_config.deep_merge`, use `read_yaml_file` for file-based YAML reads in `store.py` and `registry/loader.py`, and add typed error handling (`YamlParseError`, `InvalidConfigStructureError`) at remaining `yaml.safe_load` sites in `backend.py` and `onboard/parser.py`.
- Add `.trivyignore` to suppress known CVEs in Debian base image system packages (perl, util-linux, tar, zlib1g, passwd, sysvinit-utils) that are not exploitable in the container's attack surface
- Dashboard Remove is now a modal instead of a chain of native `confirm()`
  dialogs. Data volumes are **preserved by default**; deleting them is an
  explicit, separately-warned opt-in checkbox (IRREVERSIBLE), and the confirm
  button changes to "⚠ Remove + DELETE data volumes" when checked. Backend
  behaviour (`DELETE /services/{name}?remove_volumes=`) is unchanged.
- Fix production image crash-loop: `ui/router.py` reads `DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` at
  import time, but `src/robotsix_central_deploy/ui/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` is a
  symlink to the canonical `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md`, so the built wheel shipped
  a dangling link and the app died on startup with `FileNotFoundError`. The
  Dockerfile now copies the real `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` into the installed
  package location. (Not caught by CI, which runs from the source tree where the
  symlink resolves.)
- Upgrade Debian system packages in Dockerfile base image to address CVEs in `python:3.14-slim` (perl, util-linux, tar, zlib1g, passwd, sysvinit-utils, and others).
- Register gateway module in docs/modules.yaml with its reverse-proxy endpoints, dependencies, and test suite.
- Add CodeQL SAST job to CI for taint-tracking vulnerability detection (security-extended and security-and-quality queries)
- Reverse DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md symlink direction: `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` is now the canonical copy, `src/robotsix_central_deploy/ui/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` symlinks to it. CI guard updated accordingly.
- Extract private helpers from long route handlers in `lifecycle/routers/`:
  `_gather_sibling_health`, `_fanout_deploy_siblings`, `_fanout_rollback_siblings`,
  `_delete_component_volumes`, `_resolve_account_mode`, `_postprocess_config_assist`
  (services.py); `_deploy_onboard_siblings`, `_rollback_onboard` (onboard.py).
- Consolidate `volume_audit` as a sub-package of `lifecycle` (`src/robotsix_central_deploy/lifecycle/volume_audit/`) to reflect their strong coupling (shared config prefix, cross-imports).
- Enable the periodic security posture workflow to inspect CI workflows and pre-commit config against evolving OWASP/OpenSSF/SLSA best practices.
- Remove dead code: `is_active()` function and `ACTIVE_STATES` constant from `lifecycle.models` (neither had any callers).
- Remove stale `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_GHCR_TOKEN` documentation — the env var was never defined as a `LifecycleConfig` field, and `RegistryChecker` uses anonymous GHCR tokens fetched at runtime.
- Fix config-assist blanking un-submitted config: `POST /services/{name}/config/assist`
  submits only the seed fields the operator typed, but `_merge_config` reset every
  other key to the template default — so an operator's LLM api_key / observability
  config (any secret or section the assist form did not include) was silently wiped
  on each helper run. `_merge_config` gains a `prefer_existing_for_unset` flag (used
  only by the sparse config-assist path) so untouched keys keep their existing value.
  Repo-agnostic — no knowledge of any specific config key. The Save form (which
  renders every field) keeps the previous "unset → template default" behaviour.
- Define `HealthStatus`, `UpdateState`, `StoreBackend`, and `VolumeEntryType` `str, Enum` types in `lifecycle/models.py`; replace all duplicated hardcoded health/state/backend/volume-entry strings across `backend.py`, `deps.py`, `config.py`, `cli.py`, and `schemas.py` with canonical enum references. Add a CI `grep-lint` job to prevent raw-string backsliding.
- Add CI security scanning: `uv audit` for dependency vulnerabilities, ruff `S` (flake8-bandit) rules for SAST, Trivy container image scanning, and Gitleaks secret detection. Dockerfile converted to multi-stage to keep build-time tooling out of the runtime image.
- Add dedicated unit tests for the onboard fetcher module in ``tests/onboard/test_fetcher.py``, exercising real local git repos for clone-and-read integration logic.
- Add orphan-volume pruning: `GET /volumes/orphans` lists Docker volumes owned
  by no registered component and not attached to any container, and
  `POST /volumes/prune` removes them (IRREVERSIBLE). A component's own volumes
  (even when stopped) and in-use volumes are never pruned; the eligible set is
  recomputed server-side on every call. The dashboard gains an **Orphan Volumes**
  panel with a "Prune all" button (shown only when orphans exist).
- Fix missing re-exports in ``lifecycle/server.py`` backward-compat shim: add ``shutil``, ``NoopBackend``, and ``_fetch_fresh_config_assist`` so test monkeypatches resolve correctly after the modular split.
- Refactor monolithic `lifecycle/server.py` (2869 lines) into per-resource
  modules using FastAPI's `APIRouter` pattern:
  - `lifecycle/routers/health.py` — `/health`, `/disk`, `/disk/reclaim`
  - `lifecycle/routers/services.py` — all `/services/{name}/...` endpoints
  - `lifecycle/routers/volumes.py` — `/volumes/...` endpoints
  - `lifecycle/routers/onboard.py` — `/onboard/preflight`, `/onboard/confirm`
  - `lifecycle/schemas.py` — extracted Pydantic request/response models
  - `lifecycle/deps.py` — dependency factories, helpers, lifespan
  - `lifecycle/app.py` — FastAPI app assembly and router registration
  - `lifecycle/server.py` — backward-compatibility re-export shim
- Deduplicate `DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md`: keep canonical copy in `src/robotsix_central_deploy/ui/` (where the server reads it) and replace `docs/DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md` with a symlink. Trim `README.md` to a minimal overview — full content lives in mkdocs. Add CI guard against accidental copy drift. (mill: Deduplicate DEPLOY_CONTRACT.md — eliminate identical copy in docs/ and src/robotsix_central_deploy/ui/ (20260701T091044Z-deduplicate-deploy-contract-md-eliminate-8f52))
- Add `.yaml` extension to 6 periodic agent definition files (`audit`, `completeness_check`, `copy_paste`, `health`, `module_curator`, `test_gap`) so they are picked up by the periodic loader
- Fix 15 mypy errors and switch mypy to blocking mode in CI: add `types-PyYAML` and `types-docker` stubs, annotate bare `dict` types in `server.py`, add type annotations to `NoopBackend.run_config_assist` and `DockerBackend.run_config_assist`, add `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` for docker, and set `mypy-advisory: false` so new type errors fail the build.
- Volume audit findings are now filed as board tickets when board API settings
  are configured (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_BOARD_API_URL`, `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_BOARD_API_TOKEN`,
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_BOARD_REPO_ID`). The `robotsix-board-agent` library is now
  a project dependency.
- **Fix circular import in volume_audit**: moved `ExecutionBackend` and `LifecycleConfig`
  imports in `volume_audit/scheduler.py` under `TYPE_CHECKING` to break a circular import
  chain (`lifecycle` → `server` → `volume_audit.scheduler` → `lifecycle.backend`) that
  caused `ImportError` during test collection.

- Dashboard: primary row health badge now reflects overall component health (primary + siblings) with a per-container breakdown tooltip on hover.

- **Sibling health in component status**: `GET /services/{name}` now includes
  `sibling_health` (per-container health snapshots for sibling services) and
  `overall_health` (a component-level rollup that considers the primary plus
  all healthchecked siblings). Siblings without a Docker healthcheck are neutral
  and do not affect the rollup.

- **Volume browser**: added `GET /volumes/{name}/ls?path=` and
  `GET /volumes/{name}/cat?path=` backend endpoints plus a read-only
  volume-browser modal in the dashboard UI. Operators can click a volume
  in the disk panel, browse directories, and read text file contents
  (read-only, auth-protected, path-traversal safe).

- **Volume namespacing for onboarding**: `onboard_confirm` now prefixes all
  named-volume host names with the component name (e.g. `mail-auto-mail-config`
  instead of `auto-mail-config`) so two components from the same Docker image
  never share storage. `onboard_preflight` gains a volume-collision check (HTTP
  409) that prevents onboarding when the namespaced names would collide with an
  existing component's `named_volumes`.
- **Fix auto-detect add-account config corruption**: Fixed four bugs in `POST
  /services/{name}/config/assist` add_new mode that together corrupted existing
  accounts when adding a new one via auto-detect. The user-provided account name (or
  email-derived slug) is now always used as the new account's id, never a template
  placeholder like `<account-N>`. Existing account credentials are preserved
  verbatim in the pre-detect volume write so detect does not re-validate them. The
  post-detect merge no longer replaces the accounts list wholesale — existing
  accounts always come from storage. The seed bar's `accounts.0.*` overwrite no
  longer corrupts existing account slot 0 during re-merge. Invalid account ids are
  rejected with HTTP 422 before the detect command runs.
- **Reclaim build cache**: `POST /disk/reclaim` endpoint triggers Docker build-cache
  pruning via `ExecutionBackend.prune_builds()`. Returns `{"space_reclaimed_bytes": <int>}`.
  Noop and CLI backends return `0`; the SDK backend calls `docker builder prune` and
  reports the `SpaceReclaimed` value from the Docker API. Dashboard UI now includes a
  "Reclaim" button next to the "Build cache reclaimable" row on the disk panel.
- **Account name input in auto-detect**: The config-assist seed bar now shows an
  "Account name" text input when the component has account seeds. The value is sent as
  `account_name` in the request body and, when non-empty, overrides the email-derived
  account id slug in `add_new` mode. Removed automatic `default_account` normalization
  from the assist endpoint.
- **Centralized error handlers**: extracted inline `HTTPException` handler into
  `register_error_handlers()` in `lifecycle/error_handlers.py`. Added handlers for
  `RequestValidationError` (422 with structured `ErrorDetail` envelope) and a
  catch-all `Exception` handler (500 with safe, non-leaking response). All error
  responses now share the `{"error": ..., "detail": ...}` shape.
- **Settings disk warning threshold:** `disk_warn_bytes` renamed to `disk_warn_pct`
  (a float percentage, default 10.0%).  The Settings form now accepts "Disk Warning
  (% free)" with a `step=0.1` numeric input, and the `/disk` endpoint returns
  `warn_threshold_pct` instead of `warn_threshold_bytes`.  The disk panel displays a
  "Warn threshold" row and a dynamic banner like "⚠ Low disk space — free space is
  below X%!".  Existing `settings.json` files with the old `disk_warn_bytes` key
  silently drop it and use the 10.0% default.
- **Settings form secret-field placeholders**: `auth_password`
  now renders as `••• set — enter a new value to change` placeholder when configured
  (instead of disabled `***` in the value, which was indistinguishable from empty).
  Saving without clicking Change preserves the stored secret via `'***'` sentinel.
- **Disk warning threshold as percentage**: renamed `disk_warn_bytes` to
  `disk_warn_percent` (float, default 10.0) throughout the stack —
  `SystemSettings`, `LifecycleConfig`, settings API models, and the dashboard
  Settings form. `GET /disk` now computes `warn_threshold_bytes` as
  `int(disk_warn_percent / 100.0 * total_bytes)` at request time. The env var
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_DISK_WARN_BYTES` is replaced by
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_DISK_WARN_PERCENT`. Old `settings.json` files with
  `disk_warn_bytes` silently fall back to the 10% default.

- **Settings GET reflects env-var credentials**: `GET /settings` now reads
  from the effective config (env vars overlaid by stored settings) instead of
  the raw store, so env-var-supplied auth credentials appear in the UI even
  before the operator has saved settings via the UI.
- **Volume audit subsystem**: New optional `volume_audit` module that periodically
  scans Docker named volumes for size and growth-over-time tracking. Growth
  threshold breaches are reported through a pluggable `report_finding` seam
  (placeholder: persists to local JSON + logs WARNING). Configurable via
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_VOLUME_AUDIT_*` environment variables; disabled by default.
  New `GET /volumes/audit` endpoint returns live growth records.
- **Settings: mark GHCR Pull Token as optional** — label reads "GHCR Pull Token
  (optional)", placeholder text "Leave blank for public images", and help row
  "Only required for private GHCR registry images." to clarify it is not
  required for public images.
- **Dashboard panel for volume audit** — per-component volume sizes, growth
  deltas, and flagged findings shown under the Disk Usage section.

- **Fix: config-form Save corrupts multi-account configs** — five coordinated
  fixes for the `GET /config → form render → collectConfigValues → PUT /config`
  chain: (1) `_merge_config` dict-branch now recurses correctly when the
  destination key is absent from existing config, preventing `"***"` sentinel
  literals from being written to storage; (2) new `_prune_unset` post-merge
  pass removes template-default empty fields that were absent from existing,
  preventing resurrected `archive.namespace` etc.; (3) new
  `_validate_account_ids` server-side + client-side pre-fetch validation
  reject invalid account `id` slugs (e.g. email addresses with `@`) before
  they can crash-loop auto-mail; (4) `saveConfigValues` now calls
  `closeConfigModal()` on success instead of re-opening the modal; (5)
  array-item accordion headers prefer `itemCurrent.email` over `id`/`name`
  for human-readable account labels.
- **Account-aware config assist**: `POST /services/{name}/config/assist` now
  supports a `target_account_index` field to control whether auto-detect
  updates an existing account or adds a new one.  When omitted and accounts
  already exist, the new `add_new` mode injects a derived account ID and
  strips `--overwrite` from the detect command so existing accounts are not
  destroyed.  Backward-compatible: first-setup behaviour is unchanged.
- **Fix: auto-detect add-account corrupts existing account and leaks
  placeholders** — the seed bar in the config form collects values under
  `accounts.0.*`, but `add_new` mode rewrites placeholders to `accounts.N.*`.
  The server now relocates seed values from the template index (0) to the
  target slot so the volume seed write does not overwrite an existing account's
  username, `{accounts.N.*}` placeholders resolve to the submitted email rather
  than staying literal, and the account ID is derived from the email instead
  of falling back to `accounts-N`.
- **Fix: `_mask_secrets` no longer filters by secret-name heuristic** — removed
  the `_is_secret_name(key)` guard so that any leaf whose template value is
  `""` or `None` is treated as a secret and masked as `"***"`, matching the
  function's documented contract.
- **Dashboard: show per-component subdomain URLs** — the "↗ Open" link for each
  component now points to ``https://<name>.<gateway_base_domain>/`` instead of
  ``https://<gateway_base_domain>/<name>/``. Falls back to ``/<name>/`` when no
  ``gateway_base_domain`` is configured.
- **Gateway: add subdomain routing for component UIs** — each component is now
  reachable at ``<name>.<gateway_base_domain>/...`` (Host-header routing) so apps
  that embed absolute paths (e.g. ``/static/board.css``, ``/move``) work at root
  without the legacy ``/<name>/`` path prefix. The ``http_proxy`` Location-rewrite
  hack is now gated on ``prefix`` being non-empty (no rewrite for subdomain
  routing). The existing path-prefix fallback (``/<name>/...``) is preserved as
  a backward-compat path.

- **Config assist: persist detected config and normalise default_account** —
  `POST /services/{name}/config/assist` now persists the detected config to
  the `config_yaml_store` so that `GET /services/{name}/config` shows the
  detected values and clicking Save is idempotent (no longer clobbers working
  settings).  `_seed_for_detect` no longer writes template-default empty
  strings into the config volume, fixing blank config-assist forms.  When
  `merged["accounts"][0]["id"]` is set and `default_account` is absent/empty,
  `default_account` is normalised to that id.
- **Gateway: forward `x-forwarded-prefix`** — HTTP and WebSocket gateway
  proxies now set `x-forwarded-prefix: /{name}` so that upstream apps served
  under a subpath can construct correct absolute URLs.
- **Add MkDocs documentation infrastructure** — added `mkdocs.yml` with
  mkdocs-material theme and mkdocstrings[python] plugin for auto-generated
  API reference. New `docs/` dependency group in `pyproject.toml`
  (`uv sync --group docs`). `docs/index.md` converts the README into the
  MkDocs home page; `docs/api.md` stubs auto-generated API docs for all
  modules; `docs/changelog.md` includes `CHANGELOG.md` via pymdownx.snippets.
  `README.md` now points readers to the hosted docs site.
- **Document 16 missing lifecycle environment variables** — added
  `Auth`, `Docker`, `Disk`, `Registry`, `Logging`, `Gateway`, and
  `Claude Integration` sections to `docs/configuration.md`, and extended
  the `Persistence` table with store-path variables. All 22
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_*` env vars defined in `LifecycleConfig` are now
  documented.
- **Enable `env_doc_sync` periodic workflow** — added
  `.robotsix-mill/periodic/env_doc_sync.yaml` stub so that the
  `env_doc_sync` periodic workflow cross-references Pydantic Settings
  env vars against `docs/configuration.md` and files draft tickets for
  documentation gaps.
- **Config-assist API endpoint and dashboard UI** — added
  `POST /services/{name}/config/assist` endpoint that runs a component's
  repo-declared config-assist command in a one-shot container and returns
  auto-filled config values without persisting to the config store. Extended
  `GET /services/{name}/config` to return `config_assist_command` and
  `config_assist_seeds` fields. The config modal now shows an "Auto-detect /
  Assist" button and orange-bordered seed fields for components that declare
  the `robotsix.deploy.config-assist` label.
- **Config-assist seed-value placeholder substitution** — the config-assist
  command template now supports `{dotted.path}` placeholders that are
  substituted with the user's submitted seed values (navigated from the
  form body via dotted-path notation including list indices).  Detected
  output is deep-merged into the submitted config so the assist command
  never clobbers fields the user already entered.

- **Settings page: gateway base domain and Claude mount path** — added
  `gateway_base_domain` and `claude_host_mount_path` to `SystemSettings`,
  `LifecycleConfig`, the settings API (`GET`/`PUT /settings`), and the dashboard
  Settings UI. The `gateway_base_domain` is used at startup to build absolute
  `↗ Open` shortcut URLs for proxied services. The `claude_host_mount_path`
  replaces the hardcoded `~/.claude` default when set (requires service restart).

- **Populated `config/components.yaml`** — pinned all six components to non-`:latest`
  image tags (`:main` for robotsix services, `:3.3.0.0` for radicale), filled every
  `env` block with required environment keys, assigned non-conflicting host ports
  (8200–8202, 8300, 3000, 5232), confirmed named volumes and stateful-volume
  annotations, and removed all 18 `TODO` placeholder markers.

- **Configuration documentation** — added `docs/configuration.md` documenting
  all `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_*` environment variables (host, port, API key, store
  backend/path, execution backend).

- **Fleet alignment bootstrap** — added `.robotsix-mill/config.yaml`,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (calling robotsix-mill reusable `python-ci.yml`),
  and `AGENT.md`. Added `[tool.mypy]` with `strict = true` and
  `[tool.coverage]` with `fail_under = 80` to `pyproject.toml`. Added
  `mypy`, `coverage`, `pytest-cov`, and `ruff` to dev dependencies.
  Fixed all `mypy --strict` type errors across the codebase.

- **Per-component config.yaml support** — central-deploy now fetches and parses
  `config/config.yaml` from onboarded repos at preflight time, persists the schema
  and user-saved values in `ConfigYamlStore`, exposes `GET`/`PUT /services/{name}/config`
  endpoints with secret masking, and writes merged YAML into a `{name}-config` Docker
  named volume at onboard and on every save. The deploy-contract docs are updated with
  the new `config/config.yaml` convention.

- **Config modal UI** — each component card now has a "Configure" button that opens
  an auto-generated form based on the config schema. Supports nested sections,
  secret fields with sentinel preservation (`***`), and safe refresh on save.

- **Fix OpenAPI/runtime mismatch in error responses** — the global
  `http_exception_handler` now returns `ErrorDetail` instances instead of raw dicts,
  ensuring runtime error bodies match the OpenAPI-declared `ErrorDetail` schema
  (`{"error": "...", "detail": "..."}`).

- **`DELETE /services/{name}` endpoint** — removes an onboarded component, its service
  records, environment variables, secrets, and in-memory registry entry. Supports an
  optional `?stop_container=false` query parameter to skip container stop/removal
  (default: `true`). Container stop and remove are best-effort — errors are logged at
  `WARNING` and do not abort the deletion. Sibling services are also stopped, removed,
  and cleaned up.

- **Calendar stack contract-conforming compose files** — authored
  `# central-deploy-contract-version: 1` compose files for `robotsix-calendar-agent`
  and `robotsix-radicale` and pushed them to their respective repos.  The calendar-agent
  compose removes the `build:` block, `restart:`, `extra_hosts:`, and watchtower labels;
  converts env vars to the contract `KEY=default` / `KEY=` syntax; and adds a healthcheck
  matching the Dockerfile (`CMD python /app/healthcheck.py`).  The radicale repo (newly
  created) wraps `tomsquest/docker-radicale` with a `radicale-data` named volume carrying
  the `robotsix.deploy.stateful` label.

- Updated `config/components.yaml` baseline entries for `calendar-agent` and `radicale`
  with correct image refs, env keys, healthcheck commands, and the `stateful_volumes`
  annotation for `radicale-data`.

- **Dashboard Remove button** — added a per-row "Remove" button to the component
  dashboard that calls `DELETE /services/{name}?stop_container=<bool>`. Two
  `window.confirm` prompts guard against accidental removal: the first selects
  whether to also stop/remove the container, the second is a final confirmation.

- **Dashboard env/secrets config modal** — added a per-component "Config" button
  that opens an env/secrets editing modal.  Users can view, add, edit, and delete
  environment variables and secrets from the UI without SSH.  The modal uses the
  existing `GET/PUT/DELETE /services/{name}/env` API endpoints and matches the
  dashboard's dark theme styling.

- **Parse `container_name` from compose YAML** — `parse_compose()` now reads
  `container_name` from the service definition and passes it through `DerivedSpec`.
  `onboard_confirm` uses `spec.container_name or spec.name` to set the container name
  on both `ComponentConfig` and `ServiceRecord`.  Empty string defaults to the component
  name, matching the existing broker (agent-comm) behaviour.

- **Encrypted env secrets storage** — new `SecretKeyManager` (Fernet key generation
  and encrypt/decrypt) and `EnvStore` (JSON persistence for per-component env overrides
  and encrypted secret tokens).  Three new API endpoints:
  `GET /services/{name}/env` (returns plaintext env + masked secrets),
  `PUT /services/{name}/env` (upsert env values and secrets),
  `DELETE /services/{name}/env/{key}` (remove a key from env or secrets).
  Merged env (base YAML + user overrides + decrypted secrets) is injected into
  container creation at `deploy_service()` and `rollback_service()` time.
  New config fields: `env_store_path` (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_ENV_STORE_PATH`,
  default `component_env.json`) and `secret_key_path`
  (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_SECRET_KEY_PATH`, default `secrets.key`).
  Added `cryptography>=41.0` dependency.

- **Onboard UI modal** — "Add Component" button on the dashboard opens a two-step
  onboard modal: enter git URL + name, fetch+review the derived spec (ports, volumes,
  env, Claude mount), edit secrets, and deploy.  Stateful volumes show an amber
  "starts EMPTY" warning.  Validation errors and 409 conflicts are surfaced inline.
- **Onboard API endpoints** — new `POST /onboard/preflight` (fetch+validate a service
  repo's compose) and `POST /onboard/confirm` (persist config, deploy container,
  register component).  Dynamic `ComponentConfigStore` persists onboarded components
  to JSON and re-loads them on server restart.  `DockerSdkBackend` pre-creates named
  volumes before container creation and injects an optional `~/.claude` host mount.

- **Volume error handling** — named volume creation in `DockerSdkBackend.deploy()`
  is wrapped in try/except with clear error messages for invalid volume names and
  Docker daemon connectivity issues.  Volume-already-exists (HTTP 409) errors are
  handled gracefully with a log message.
  Added `claude_mount`, `named_volumes`, and `stateful_volumes` fields to
  `ComponentConfig`.
- **Onboard-from-git compose parser** — new `onboard` package with
  `fetch_compose_bytes` (shallow git clone + raw bytes) and
  `parse_compose` (validates against the v1 deploy contract and
  returns a `DerivedSpec`).  Contract covers: single-service, no-build,
  named-volume-only, env key extraction, healthcheck Go-duration
  conversion, and `robotsix.deploy.*` extension labels (claude-mount,
  stateful-volume flagging).
  - `docs/deploy-contract.md` updated: missing header = parse error,
    image accepts any non-empty string, env allows preset defaults,
    driver enforcement removed.
- **Enable `VOLUMES=1` on socket-proxy** — named-volume create/list/inspect/remove
  calls now pass through the Docker socket proxy, in preparation for
  managed-service volume creation in the self-service deploy flow.
- **Dashboard "Up to date" column** — the live dashboard now displays an
  "Up to date" column showing each component's update state as a colored
  badge (green "up to date", amber "update available" with digest tooltip,
  grey "unknown").  Column sits between Health and Actions.
- **Registry image-update detection** — new `registry_check` subpackage with
  `RegistryChecker` that polls the GHCR registry for the latest manifest
  digest and compares against the deployed image digest.
  - `GET /services/{name}` now returns `update_available` (bool),
    `running_digest`, and `latest_digest` fields.
  - `GET /services` list items include `update_available`.
  - New config options: `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_REGISTRY_CHECK_TTL` (cache seconds, default 300),
    `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_REGISTRY_CHECK_INTERVAL` (background poll seconds;
    0 disables).
  - `deployed_image_digest` now stores the manifest digest (from
    `RepoDigests`) instead of the image config digest, making it
    comparable to the registry's `Docker-Content-Digest` header.
  - Background task updates all service records periodically when
    `registry_check_interval > 0`; shuts down cleanly on server exit.

- **Added `follow` query param to logs endpoint** — `GET /services/{name}/logs`
  now accepts `follow=bool` (default `false`).  When `follow=true`, the
  `DockerSdkBackend` passes `follow=True` to the Docker SDK and iterates log
  chunks via `run_in_executor` instead of a bare synchronous `for` loop,
  preventing event-loop blocking.  `NoopBackend` and `DockerBackend` stubs
  accept the new parameter.  Client disconnects trigger `log_iter.close()` via
  `asyncio.CancelledError` handling.

- **Removed legacy `auth_username`/`auth_password` fields** from
  `LifecycleConfig` — these env vars were no longer consulted by
  `verify_auth`, which matches passwords against `api_key` alone.
- **Removed dead backward-compat alias** — `verify_api_key = verify_auth`
  alias removed from `src/robotsix_central_deploy/lifecycle/auth.py`.  All
  callers already use `verify_auth` directly.
- **Monitoring UI dashboard** — new `GET /ui` endpoint serves a self-contained
  HTML dashboard at `/ui` showing live component status, image revision (first 12
  chars), health, and start/stop/restart controls.  Auth-gated via `verify_auth`;
  auto-refreshes every 30 s.  Logs column placeholder present for future
  logs-viewer ticket.  No external CDN dependencies (vanilla JS + CSS).
- **Log viewer modal** — clicking "Logs" for any component opens a dark-themed
  modal that streams container logs via `fetch` + `ReadableStream` (no page
  reload).  Shows last 200 lines then live-follows new output.  Close via × button
  or Escape key aborts the fetch cleanly.  Auth credentials included
  (`credentials: 'same-origin'`); 401 errors surface in the status bar.
- **Unified auth** — `verify_auth` now accepts `Authorization: Basic` where the
  password equals `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_API_KEY` (username is ignored).  Added
  `verify_api_key = verify_auth` alias for backward compatibility.  New private
  helper `_decode_basic_auth`.  Realm changed to `"Robotsix Central Deploy"`.
  Existing `X-API-Key` header path unchanged.

- **Docker socket proxy** — added `docker_socket_url` config field (`ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_DOCKER_SOCKET_URL`, default `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) and a `docker-compose.yml` with `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy` sidecar scoped to `CONTAINERS`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `IMAGES` API paths. Raw socket mounted read-only into proxy only; central-deploy talks TCP.
- **Logs streaming endpoint** — `GET /services/{name}/logs` returns container
  logs as `text/plain` (auth-gated).  Supports `tail` (1–10000, default 100)
  and `since` (ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp) query parameters.  Implemented for
  `DockerSdkBackend` (real logs via Docker SDK), `NoopBackend` (stub), and
  `DockerBackend` (CLI stub).
- **HTTP Basic Auth support** — `verify_auth` dependency now accepts either
  `X-API-Key` header or `Authorization: Basic` credentials. New config fields
  `auth_username` / `auth_password` (env: `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_AUTH_USERNAME`,
  `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_AUTH_PASSWORD`). Auth failures return `401` with
  `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Central Deploy"` to trigger browser login
  dialogs. `GET /services` and `GET /services/{name}` are now authenticated
  when credentials are configured. `GET /health` remains open.
- **Component registry** — Pydantic models (`ComponentConfig`, `PortMapping`,
  `VolumeMount`, `HealthCheck`) and a YAML loader (`ComponentRegistry.from_yaml`)
  that declares every managed Docker component in a single source of truth.
- **Seed configuration** (`config/components.yaml`) — stub entries for the six
  current server services: cost-monitor, calendar-agent, auto-mail, chat, broker
  (agent-comm), and radicale.
- **Lifecycle config** — added `registry_path` field and `effective_registry_path`
  property to `LifecycleConfig`, overridable via `ROBOTSIX_LIFECYCLE_REGISTRY_PATH`.

- **Docker SDK backend** — new `DockerSdkBackend` talks to the Docker daemon
  directly via the Python Docker SDK (no CLI subprocess).  `status()` returns a
  `ComponentInspect` with image revision and health; `start`/`stop`/`restart`
  use the SDK's container API.  The abstract `ExecutionBackend.status()` now
  returns `ComponentInspect` and the old `DockerBackend` was updated to match.
- Enable periodic analysis workflows: audit, health, test_gap,
  module_curator, completeness_check, copy_paste, state_sync.
